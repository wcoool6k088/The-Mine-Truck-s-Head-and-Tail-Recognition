# The-Mine-Truck-s-Head-and-Tail-Recognition
In recent years, vehicle identification technology is widely used in mine supervision, traffic control and other fields, and has been widely valued and concerned by researchers . Therefore, the fine identification of the license plate, head and tail of the transport vehicle and the shape of the minerals truck load in the mining area is not only of great significance for the effective management of mine resources, but also can avoid the illegal behavior of tax evasion. In the mining environment, there are many kinds of vehicles in and out. In addition to transport vehicles, there are trucks, SUVs, buses and other types of vehicles. In addition, there are also waste resources such as ballast. Therefore, it is of great significance for the construction of mine comprehensive supervision platform to effectively identify the transport vehicles and the goods they trucker and eliminate the interference of other types of vehicles. When the mine environmental supervision system captures the photos of the head and tail of the truck, it is impossible to give the impact of tax evasion caused by the problem of the head and tail of the truck distinction. The purpose of this paper is to solve the problem that the head and tail of the mine transportation vehicle could not be identified accurately. The comparison between the head and tail images is shown in Figure1.
